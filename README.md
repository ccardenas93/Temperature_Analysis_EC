# Temperature Trend Analysis

This project conducts a comprehensive analysis of temperature trends across different regions using various statistical and visualization techniques.

## Description

The code provided merges temperature data from multiple regions, analyzes trends using linear regression, and visualizes these trends over time. The goal is to identify if there's a significant warming trend in the analyzed regions.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib

### Installing

- Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
- Install the required libraries using pip:
  ```
  pip install pandas numpy scipy matplotlib
  ```

### Executing Program

1. Place your temperature data files in the known directory.
2. Modify the file paths in the script to match your directory structure.
3. Run the script to merge the data, perform the analysis, and visualize the results.

## Code Breakdown

1. **Data Loading and Merging**: Temperature data from different regions are loaded and merged based on the date.

2. **Trend Analysis**: A linear regression analysis is conducted for each region to identify temperature trends.

3. **Visualization**: Trends are visualized using line plots, with the data points and regression lines indicating the trend over time.
